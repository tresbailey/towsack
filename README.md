Burlap has recently become a hipster trend for events as decorations, but burlap has been used to create store and carry sacks known as tow sacks.  These tow sacks have been used to carry all sorts of items and keep them stored in barns and buildings all over rural areas.  Like these tow sacks, most companies need to store a variety of data, with increasing needs for time to deliver and flexibility of the model.  This has given rise to the NoSQL movement, but many companies have resisted this, due to the unknown and the risks for their operations teams.  But because of the fast-paced needs of mobile dev teams, these companies have to find a solution.  With TowSack, these companies can stuff and carry their data using a traditional backend database, Postgres.
